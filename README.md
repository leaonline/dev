# dev
The main development repository. Clones all repos as submodules in their respective structure.


## Getting started

If you need help with submodules, please check out the following resources:

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules

https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule

There is an architectural overview in the [architecture](./architecture) folder, which is a good starting point.
